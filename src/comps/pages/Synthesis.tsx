                <h1>What I learned</h1>
                
                <p>Throughout my internship at Fasttrack Solutions Inc., I gained valuable insights into the workings of a consulting company and my role as a 
                Computer Science professional. I acquired hands-on experience with ERP systems, learned JavaScript and its application in NetSuite, and 
                participated in a real project with a team, where I honed my communication skills as part of the CODEX training program. </p>

                <p>Working within a team highlighted the importance of each role and the challenges that arise when one member is unavailable, emphasizing 
                the necessity for versatility and adaptability. I also learned the value of acquiring knowledge beyond my core Computer Science skills, 
                as it aids in effectively verifying and improving my work output. This experience demonstrated that skills developed during my Computer 
                Science studies are applicable and valuable across various industries, even those not primarily focused on technology. </p>

                <p>In conclusion, my internship at Fasttrack Solutions Inc. has been an enriching experience that has broadened my understanding of the 
                consulting industry and enhanced my technical and soft skills. It has prepared me for future professional challenges, reinforcing the 
                importance of continuous learning and adaptability in a dynamic work environment.</p>
