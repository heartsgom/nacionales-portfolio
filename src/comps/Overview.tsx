            <h1>An Overview of my Practicum</h1>
            I was accepted as an intern at Fasttrack Solutions Inc., located in the Valero Tower in Makati City. Fasttrack is a software and consulting company specializing in 
            cloud technology implementation, ERP/CRM deployment, and vertical solutions. While they are best known for their SAP implementations, they have also expanded to other 
            ERP systems, including Acumatica and Smartbooks. Additionally, they offer business analytics services, such as data warehousing, data transformation, and data 
            visualization. With over 18 years of operation, Fasttrack has offices in Cebu, Davao, and internationally in Singapore. They serve various industries and count 
            the Ayala Foundation, Unilab, Sanicare, and Healthy Options among their key business partners. <br /><br /> The company has developed a training program called the Consultant 
            Online Development and Excellence Program (CODEX), designed to nurture high-potential talents with in-demand IT skills. I was assigned to the Oracle NetSuite ERP 
            Program Track, managed by Cloudtech ERP, a Fasttrack subsidiary focused on Oracle, NetSuite, and Salesforce. <br /><br /> The practicum consists of three phases. The first phase, 
            General IT and Soft Skills, covers fundamental concepts such as programming basics, communication skills, SQL, and proficiency with Excel and Microsoft Visio. Each 
            phase concludes with an assessment that must be passed to proceed. The second phase, Product-Specific Training, involves mastering the system we will be using. The 
            final phase, Work Immersion and Case Study, requires completing a case study prepared by our supervisor and potentially being deployed to assist on a real project.
            168 hours were rendered during the CODEX Training, and 156 hours during the Work Immersion. The total amount of hours rendered was 324 hours, completing the minimum 
            requirement for work hours rendered. The internship started the 22nd of May, 2024, and ended the 21st of June, 2024.
