                <p>During my internship at Fasttrack, I was assigned to two projects: The CODEX Case Study and a client project for Solutions Exchange,
                    one of Cloudtech's clients. The Case Study focused on script debugging and utilizing Advanced PDF/HTML Templates, Netsuite's 
                    customizable forms powered by Apache Freemarker, a Java-based template engine. Netsuite's scripting language, SuiteScript, 
                    is based on JavaScript and is used for batch processes, custom validations and calculations, executing searches, and performing CRUD operations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Solutions Exchange project I was assigned to the CAS Configuration where I had to adjust the templates per the client's requests.
                    Some of the templates I adjusted were the templates for the Sales Invoice, Collection Receipt, and Credit Memo.
